# ORCHIDEE TBM Parameter DA Review and Perspectives

Simulations and scripts for plotting figures in MacBean et al. (2022) "Quantifying and Reducing Uncertainty in Global Carbon Cycle Predictions: Lessons and Perspectives From 15 Years of Data Assimilation Studies with the ORCHIDEE Terrestrial Biosphere Model"

Note that this is mostly a review paper, so the data, model simulations, and
scripts have been documented in all the references cited. However, we have
summarized results from multiple papers into new synthesis figures (Figs. 2 to
5) in this paper. The simulations and scripts used to produce these figures are
documented in this repository. Figure 6 is unpublished work; therefore, we also
document the simulations, observations, and scripts used to produce this figure.

Please see the ORCHIDEE DA System (ORCHIDAS) website for further details on our
assimilation system, publications, and ongoing research: https://orchidas.lsce.ipsl.fr
